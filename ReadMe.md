## ADMIT A NEW ORGANIC PET
This option will give you the ability to create a new Organic Pet, first by asking for the name and then providing a list of five (5) species to choose
from, consisting of Wolf, Fox, Red Panda, Dragon, and Rabbit. Upon completion of creating an Organic Pet, you will be brought back to the Main Menu.


## ADMIT A NEW ROBOTIC PET
This option will give you the ability to create a new Robotic Pet, first by asking for the name and then providing a list of five (5) species to choose
from, consisting of Wolf, Fox, Red Panda, Dragon, and Rabbit. Upon completion of creating a Robotic Pet, you will be brought back to the Main Menu.


## SEE ALL PETS THAT ARE CURRENTLY HERE
This option will display all Pets that are currently in the shelter, and will also show their HEALTH/RUST LEVEL, HUNGER/BATTERY, and BOREDOM/IDLENESS stats.


## INTERACT WITH A SINGLE PET
This option will allow you to interact with the Pet, consisting of Play, Feed/Recharge, and taking to the vet/mechanic. Each interaction will affect the Pet's stats
accordingly:
- Play will increase their HEALTH/decrease their RUST LEVEL and decrease their BOREDOM/IDLENESS, but will increase their HUNGER/decrease their BATTERY.
- Feed/Recharge will decrease their HUNGER/increase their BATTERY.
- Take to vet/mechanic will increase their HEALTH/decrease their RUST LEVEL.

NOTE: The application starts off with zero (0) Pets, and will display a message saying that there are currently no Pets to interact with. You will need to create
a new Pet before you will be able to interact with one.


## INTERACT WITH ALL PETS
This option will allow you to interact with all Pets in the shelter, consisting of Play, Feed/Recharge, and taking them to the vet/mechanic. Each interaction will affect
the Pets' stats accordingly:
- Play will increase their HEALTH/decrease their RUST LEVEL and decrease their BOREDOM/IDLENESS, but will increase their HUNGER/decrease their BATTERY.
- Feed/Recharge will decrease their HUNGER/increase their BATTERY.
- Take to vet/mechanic will increase their HEALTH/decrease their RUST LEVEL.

NOTE: The application starts off with zero (0) Pets, and will display a message saying that there are currently no Pets to interact with. You will need to create
a new Pet before you will be able to interact with any of them.
